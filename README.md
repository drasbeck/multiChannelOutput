multiChannelOutput
===========
multiChannelOutput is a Processing 3.0 sketch that can output sound to an interface with more than the standard two channels.

Furthermore the sketch is modified to initiate output based on Arduino input. The Arduino must have the StandardFirmata sketch running.

The sketch is based on a combination of example files from the Minim library.

###Libraries and contributed work.
multiChannelOutput makes use of the following Processing libraries:
* Arduino (Firmata) by David A. Mellis
* Minim by Damien Di Fede and Anderson Mills
* Sound by The Processing Foundation
